 # About Biblical Heralds

## Our Mission

Biblical Heralds exists to help people experience Scripture through the unique perspectives of biblical figures who walked with God. We believe that understanding how John, Peter, Barnabas, Mary of Bethany, and Deborah might interpret passages can deepen our own biblical understanding and spiritual growth.

## What We Do

### Scripture Interpretation Service
We provide biblical interpretations through the lens of five carefully chosen biblical figures, each bringing their unique personality, experiences, and spiritual insights to Scripture exploration.

- **Concordance Search** - Find verses related to specific topics like love, faith, prayer, and forgiveness  
- **Interactive Discovery** - Hidden features that reward deeper engagement with biblical content

## The Team

*"But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord." - 1 Peter 3:15*

Peter offers direct, action-oriented perspectives shaped by his experiences of failure, restoration, and bold leadership in the early church.

Barnabas provides encouraging, hope-filled interpretations based on his gift for seeing potential in people and situations.

### Mary of Bethany - The Contemplative Learner

Mary offers thoughtful, reflective insights drawn from her contemplative approach to learning from Jesus.

### Deborah - Judge and Prophetess
*"When the princes in Israel take the lead, when the people willingly offer themselves—praise the LORD!" - Judges 5:2*
