## üìù CRITICAL NOTES FOR CLAUDE

1. **NEVER change the visual design** - Clean white cards, purple header, light background
2. **API endpoint is `/api/heralds`** - NOT `/api/heralds.js`
3. **Herald names are**: John, Peter, Barnabas, Mary of Bethany, Deborah
4. **John's Easter egg image works** at `/JohnEE1.jpeg`
5. **Colors are organic/subtle** - Not explicitly mentioned to users
6. **Keep professional, trustworthy appearance** - This is a ministry platform

## üîß NEXT STEPS WHEN OPENING NEW CHAT

1. Upload this file to new chat
2. Say: "I'm continuing work on Biblical Heralds. Please review the setup file and help me with [specific task]"
