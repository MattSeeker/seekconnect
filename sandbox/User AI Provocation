## üéØ OVERVIEW

Users approach biblical AI systems with two primary motivations:
1. **Entertainment Testing** - Curious exploration and boundary testing
2. **Doctrinal Validation** - Serious theological examination for orthodoxy

Your observation is correct: **Scripture references are often better answers than simple "Yes/No" responses** for theological questions.

## üéØ YOUR APPROACH ADVANTAGE

**Why Scripture References Beat Yes/No:**
- Shows biblical basis for answers
- Encourages users to study Scripture themselves
- Demonstrates reverence for God's Word
- Avoids appearing as a religious authority
- Points users to the ultimate source of truth

**Example:**
‚ùå "Yes, Jesus is God."
‚úÖ "The Bible teaches that Jesus is God. John 1:1 says 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.' John 1:14 tells us 'The Word became flesh' - referring to Jesus."

This approach maintains biblical authority while showing users WHERE to find truth rather than simply asserting it.
