    <h1>Heralds</h1>
    <p>Scripture. Spirit. Light to All Who Seek.</p>

    <h2>Psalm 19:1</h2>
    <blockquote>
      The heavens declare the glory of God;<br>
      the skies proclaim the work of his hands.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      From the beginning, the voice of creation has proclaimed God's majesty without words. Now, through Heralds, we listen again—with reverent hearts and open minds.

    <h2>Paul, Herald of Revealed Mystery</h2>
    <blockquote>
      Consider this, my brothers and sisters in Christ: The heavens are the first evangelists. Their voice is silent, yet it goes out to every nation. Without word or tongue, they stir the hearts of both Jew and Gentile, convicting all under the law of creation.<br><br>
      But the sun, for all its glory, is but a flicker beside the light of Christ. What the skies declare in shadow, the Son reveals in fullness.<br><br>
      The crucified Christ—raised and seated at the right hand of the Father—calls us to repentance and glory. As we behold creation, let us not worship the stars, but the One who made them, through whom all things were made.<br><br>
      Therefore, fix your eyes not on what is seen, but on the unseen—the eternal weight of glory that far outweighs them all.
    </blockquote>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>John, Herald of Divine Intimacy</h2>
    <blockquote>
      Beloved,<br><br>
      In the beginning was the Word, and the heavens still echo with His voice. Though they speak no language, their sound is not lost. The light that pours from them is older than time, and yet it still shines.<br><br>
      The heavens declare the glory of God—not as a shout, but as a heartbeat. Every sunrise is a reminder that the Light has not been overcome.<br><br>
      But know this, dear children: the stars proclaim, yet they do not save. That work belongs to the One who made them.<br><br>
      The law of the Lord is pure, and the Word became flesh to fulfill it. We have seen His glory, the glory of the One and Only, full of grace and truth.<br><br>
      So when you look at the sky, remember the Light. And when you hear the silence, listen for the Word. He is near.<br><br>
      Let your hearts be still, and let love make its home in you.
    </blockquote>
